# Packet Tracer Group Tasks for Beginners

Welcome to the **Packet Tracer Group Tasks** repository.  This collection of labs is designed for students and junior network engineers who are learning Cisco networking concepts.  Each sub‑directory contains a self‑contained lab that you can open in Cisco Packet Tracer, along with detailed documentation, diagrams and sample configuration files.  The labs cover common topics such as static and dynamic routing, VLANs and trunking, inter‑VLAN routing, and remote management using SSH and Telnet.

## Labs overview

| Lab | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **static‑routing** | Learn how to build a simple multi‑router network and configure **static routes** so that hosts on separate networks can communicate. |
| **vlan‑trunking** | Build a two‑switch campus with two VLANs and configure **access and trunk ports** to extend VLANs across switches. |
| **inter‑vlan‑routing** | Use a router‑on‑a‑stick to allow hosts in different VLANs to communicate via **inter‑VLAN routing**. |
| **ssh‑telnet** | Configure a router and a switch for **remote management** using **Telnet** and the more secure **SSH** protocol. |

Each lab folder contains:

- A `README.md` describing the scenario, topology diagram (rendered via Mermaid) and step‑by‑step tasks.
- A `configs/` directory with sample device configurations you can copy and paste into Packet Tracer’s CLI.
- Optional images or diagrams to help visualise the topology.
